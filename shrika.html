<h1>General Information</h1>
<i><b>
Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosm
ologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of

 Cambridge.[7][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most
 prestigious academic posts in the world.[19]

Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education 
at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work a
t Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, 
specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone
 disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through
 use of a han
dheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[22]</i><b>

<h1>Award & Honour</h2>
<p>Hawking received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).[7] At that time
, his nomination read:

Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to

 physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly a
lone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must
 possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations
 with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase.
 In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original
 treatise on "Space-time in the Large".
